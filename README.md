# The Naive matrix multiplication algorithm
A test of the performance of various implementations of the naive algorithm for matrix multiplication in C, for matrices stored as 2D arrays.
This code compares a basic, non-optimized, function,
a vectorized function [using SSE4.1](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#techs=SSE4_1),
and a cache-blocked function.
